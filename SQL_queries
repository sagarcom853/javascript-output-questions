Display nth row in sql?

SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id
LIMIT 1 OFFSET n-1;

For example to get 5th query:

SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY employee_id
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 4;

Another option: using row_number()

SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY customer_id) AS row_num
    FROM customers
) AS numbered_rows
WHERE row_num = 3;
